<h2>Copyright on the Web</h2>

<p>Copyright will always be difficult to control on the internet. As webpage creators, we should do our due diligence to always cite our sources and give credit for the work we use on our own pages. I will discuss the need for copyright lessons in our public school systems, basic copyright knowledge, and an example of copyright infringement.
This issue extends from art to written works. If people are unable to cite their sources, then no one would be able to fact check or discover the creatorâ€™s works in more detail. We run the risk of losing the source forever. It teaches good practices for online etiquette as well. The same way written papers are valued should be automatically applied to online webpages, art, and so on.</p>
<p>Stanford Copyright and Fair Use published an article on website copyright, and how to avoid violating copyrights. Stim (2021) teaches to assume all internet items are copyrighted, always read the fine print, remove material someone claims as copyright, and investigate any copyright claims. This is a good start for basic rules. A class could be created in public schools to teach these kinds of rules. They already teach about plagiarism; copyright could become a part of these lesson plans.</p>
<p>An example of copyright issues is art theft on the internet. My younger sister creates fanart of tv shows and manga she really likes. Sometimes this means she ends up seeing her work on other people's pages. Often people crop out her social media name to pretend they made it. It's very easy to do this, especially with lesser-known artists. If small artists are creating art for free consumption, some people believe this makes it Free Use. As stated in our lecture though, the copyright applies to any creation posted to the web. If we want this mentality to end, this needs to be taught early on in life. </p>
<p>Another instigator of this kind of behavior is Pinterest, where people post pictures that link to other webpages. These pictures can be any content. Some are art, recipes, DIYs, memes, etc. Often, they are not cited properly. The issue here may be that the citation is incorrect, but a large company gets away with this because they supposedly cite their source. The source might be improperly linked.</p>
<p>I want to see a decrease in improper citation and internet theft on social media and webpages. If schools teach the content we learned in this lesson in their classes, it could help alleviate some of these issues. Copyright is important, it protects our creations and prevents plagiarism and theft.</p>
